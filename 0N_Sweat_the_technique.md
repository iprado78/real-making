# Sweat the Technique: 
## On Methods, Witting and Unwitting

> Ater the performance [of John Cage's _Theatre Piece_, he] told me he especially liked my little jazz improvisation and asked me why I hadn't done more of it.  "It only came up once, for only that length of time," I replied, mildly astonished that he seemd to be suggesting that I could or should have ignored my part (which I had diligently labored over to make it precisely according to his directions, or at least as precisely as my comprehension of them would allow).  Six months later and a bit tipsy from champagne, John told me he would never ask Merce or me or Nick (or any of the musciians who had taken part in the premiere) to do the _Theatre Piece_ again because, he said we had all done it "improperly."  All but David Tudor, that is; ony he and David do it "right."  I knew I had tried to do it "properly" (and what a time-consuming, tedious job it had been been--not the performing of it, which turned out to be sort of fun, but the hours of worker-bee drudgery paper-work prior to the performance), so I was surprised that if John truly flet that way he still contineued to make peices "indeterminate with respect to theor performance," abdicating all aesthetic jdugment and control, if, in the end, he was unable to accept the consequence.  "Right?" "Wrong?"  This from the man who wrote: "There is no need to cautiously proceed in dualistic terms of successs and failure or the beautiful and the ugly or good and and evil but rather to walk on 'not wondering' to quote Meister Eckhard, 'am I right or doing something wrong.'
- Carolyn Brown, _Chance and Circumstance_, p. 266

[ToDo - John Cage - Duchampian tradition]

Was John Cage merely a hypocrite, lacking the courage of his convictions? "John Cage Cheats", as my wife's notional meme t-shirt reads.

or wrong about how is art work actually worked, when it worked effectively?

I think the last. So many of the dead-ends of modern art have come from taking conceptual, process-related, or formal innovations that were effective in a certain context and then attemping to generalize them into statements about how art and life, but especially the crossing of their boundary, should work.

Students of the family of [non-gradual](https://www.buddhistinquiry.org/article/zazen-is-not-the-same-as-meditation/), [direct path](https://jeffwarren.org/articles/the-direct-path/), [opening-awareness](https://vajrayananow.com/2020/07/25/shi-ne-meditation/) contemplative traditions will be familiar with the conundrum.  Methods will recognize the necessary confusion Carolyn Brown must have experienced

[ToDo - Shinzen Young's system, failure mode]
