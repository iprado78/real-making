# Disco Bardo, c. 1998 and an Aryeh Nielsen Q&A, Part 1

The first Real-Making newsletter previewed what I'll write about this year, throwing in some gnomic theses and metaphors.  Some enjoyed it, while finding the prose a bit [dense](https://twitter.com/Meaningness/status/1391813919354720256).  I've also received good follow up questions from [Aryeh Nielsen](https://twitter.com/anielsen108), a principal at [Sonoma International Academy](https://sonomainternationalacademy.org/) and Chief Dharma Summarizer at Evolving Ground.  He's asked for clarification and expansion of some points.  

Consider this, then, the first in a series of newsletter after parties.  I'll answer Aryeh's questions. Exposition will proceed at a more deliberate pace.  The whole thing will feel like we're in a late 90s chill out room. There will be shoulder massages and lengthy breaks to use the restroom. An invented character, [Pseudo-Isaac Chotiner](https://www.newyorker.com/contributors/isaac-chotiner), will occasionally chime in to call me out on some presumed BS.  

## The Bardo

To be oddly specific about it, let's say Aryeh, Pseudo-Isaac and myself are hanging out on November, 22, 1998. We're at a [Toneburst Collective](http://www.toneburst.com/show) event in Worcester, MA.  It's very late in the early AM.  [DJ /rupture](https://twitter.com/djrupture?lang=en) is spinning [ambient dub](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFG8wNeDCbM) in the main hall.  There's a backroom lounge on the other side of a wall covered with X-Files memorabilia.  A velvet blacklight painting of Agent Moulder sits between two doors.  Over the left door a sign a reads, _Trust No One_; over the right, _The Truth is Out There_.  Both doors would seem to lead to the same place.

Amidst our confusion about which door to choose, a Force-Ghost apparition manifests. It's Mr. Myagi and Xena Warrior Princess, locked in Tantric embrace. In one of his many arms, Myagi holds a bonzai tree, crafted over lifetimes into a taut, sparkling Vajra.  Looking over Xena's shoulder, he says, "you do not understand these signs, but [you must choose](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nkjait7wm4k)."  Walter Benjamin also shows up, dressed in [Angel of History](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angelus_Novus) drag.  He's asking for money and doesn't have much that's intelligible to say, but he suggests walking backwards through whichever door we do choose. With that, the apparitions disappear. We make a sign of the cross, rotate 180 degrees, and take the door on the right.

A bath of vaporized Vicks rub and patchouli oil greets us as we enter the lounge. Happy for a break from the EDM, The Space's regular crowd, blue-collar queers on escape from 90s downsizing, mingle with travellers from Cambridge and Somerville.  The imports are spooning up [Food Not Bombs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_Not_Bombs#1990s:_further_development) meals they've smuggled past the bouncers underneath their Dr. Seuss hats.

Some noodlers named "Mayaderen" are improvising over a vinyl pressing of the 1960 Nixon-Kennedy debates. It's the 35th anniversary of the assassination.  Random players contribute motley sounds, patiently assembled from influences discovered in the [The Spin Alternative Record Guide (1995)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin_Alternative_Record_Guide). Aryeh and I are particularly fond of the [Fijian nose flute](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQevP-dr-Ao&t=289&authuser=2). Its tones float above most of the instrumental action. The space between them creates room for our thought and talk. We need that space, because the sound in the room is otherwise suffocating. Grooves of down-tuned [microtonal guitar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUtYLDn1ZI4) interlock with vamps on a [Farfisa organ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HM0ux8qHec8). Rumors are that the organ was bought very cheaply, secondhand. The only catch was that its middle C key is stuck in place. Lemonade was made of the situation. The band turned itself into a [Terry Riley](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbTn79x-mrI) tribute ensemble. [Soulful, parading saxes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urwn38RM8Bo) supply most of the emotional weight in the room.  The drummer, whose job it would normally be to steady the caterwaul with a [Motorik beat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GiNp119pn2g), is off tonight.  He's got an MIT Media Lab project due the following Monday. It visualizes modulations in the frequency of a sonic sine wave as [evolutions]((https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tgBl5VfLws)) in the phenotype of an ancestral [blue flower](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_flower).  The electric bass is doing what it can to pick up the slack, but the backing rhythm is sludgy. The overall effect feels like the soundtrack for an alien dwarf army invading from some Buddhist Hell Realm.  Fragmentary images of bug eyes and stub legs start replicating across every mind-stream in the room, Gremlins-style.

The music does have a clarifying effect at a more subterranean level of awareness, however. Discursive thought is settling. Attention is gradually being focused where it needs to be--at a point on the wall opposite to the band, roughly where Agent Moulder's shoulder blades would meet. An old 16mm reel projection of Metropolis (1927) is centered there. As Kennedy [pivots](https://youtu.be/AYP8-oxq8ig?t=1720) a question about his experience towards his vision for a vibrant American future in the 60s, [Weimar intimations of apocalypse](https://youtu.be/OZ_mcUz8hkQ?t=5321) play out. There, in their midst, we find it: the [Aleph](https://web.mit.edu/allanmc/www/borgesaleph.pdf), centerless source of the turning rainbow lights in the still disco ball at heart of the room.

Headz are nodding on couches.  Bill Clinton is about to be impeached.  Al Queda is still mostly the dream of some resentful engineers with a problematic [eternalist](https://meaningness.com/eternalism) theology. Coming off the blitz following Netscape's IPO, Aryeh and I are abuzz about the rumor on Slashdot that Red Hat may also go public.  We're trying to figure out our own business model for an open-source education startup. Blackout curtains are shielding us from the dawn's early light.  Recalling, somewhat emotionally, the final testimony of Jodi Foster's character in [Contact (1997)](https://youtu.be/8CiG9Wgvyj0?t=54), we can't figure out how we would communicate our experience of the Aleph to the outside world.

We're also trying to make sense of what the purpose of even starting our own business would be in the context of all of this, _[right Here, right Now](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub747pprmJ8)_.  It seems like the time and effort involved will just take us away from what matters.  Or maybe it won't.  Maybe there's time for both, worldly business and non-ordinary experience, but maybe each has its own proper, separate place.  The two don't need to be related.  Yet there's still a nagging desire for achieving coherence in our autobiographical narratives.  Denny's breakfast is in the offing.

## Q&A, Part 1

##### _Aryeh Nielsen: Elaborate what you mean by "congruent"._

This is going to take a long answer. There's a lot of structure to the concept, at least in the context of this Substack.

I'm borrowing the word from Charlie. It denotes the fruit of Vajrayana practice, expressed directly and spontaneously in action as we relate to others and our environment.  You can hear various references to it in their Stoa presentations, including the most recent.  I'm just beginning Vajrayana practice, but I have a background in Zen, which has many points of overlap. Both are late Buddhist traditions that come after the spread of [Buddha-nature](https://buddhanature.tsadra.org/index.php/Discover#OverviewSlides) doctrine and the so-called Third Turning of the Wheel of the Dharma. The Third Turning implies, among other things, the non-duality of spiritual realization and everyday awareness. They're neither the same nor fundamentally distinct. [Mountains are mountains](https://www.emptybowlzendo.org/mountains-and-waters-sutra), then they're not, then they are again. So we should, with the right experiential introduction, be able to appreciate intimations of realization in a wide variety of everyday contexts.

In my first newsletter, "congruent" was mainly used to express a relation of good fit between the behavior of an agent and their situation.  The agent could be an individual or a group.  It could be capable of discursive reasoning or not.  In the latter case, the agent would be something like a non-human animal, a domain-specific piece of intelligent automation, or a small child.  It just needs to be an appropriate target for the [Intentional Stance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intentional_stance). The group rational agent case is the important one, but it also introduces the most complexity.  So I am going to focus on the individual case.  I'll illustrate with some examples from my experience in web development.

The _good_ in _good fit between the behavior of an agent and their situation_ would be understood instrumentally, as _good for_ meeting the agent's already understood needs and purposes.  Being able to reliably achieve good fit is having practical knowledge.  It means acting appropriately, given the features of a situation and one's goals. The purpose of my writing is to see what such practical knowledge looks like when it's exercised inside of an idiosyncratic spiritual container. Eventually, the hope is to glimpse notions of good that are more than merely instrumental. The direction of fit between our actions and our goals gets reversed in those cases.

Let me try to explain the last point.  Heidegger, when he's discussing our everyday engagement with the world in _Being and Time_, uses a great pith that's been translated as, _action has its own kind of sight_.  He means that acting can be a way of disclosing the features of "equipment" that wouldn't be accessible to passive observation.  It's only when I'm hammering that I'm understanding what the hammer truly is. The same dynamic can apply at the meta level, to the person hammering. When I'm acting and engaging with my environment congruently, I'm also understanding what I, as an embodied self-consciousness with no fixed essence, located in a particular time and place, really am.  I'm discovering what needs and purposes it's good for me to contextually have, rather than just fluently satisfying the ones I already have. I'm simultaneously discovering _what I'm good for_ and _what it's good for me to be_ through my engagement with the situation.

Experientially, from the agent's point of view, congruence is characterized by cycling between active and receptive engagement with the features of a situation (sometimes, layering those modes rather than cycling between them).  When I'm engaging actively, I'm competently manipulating my environment to execute a task.  When I'm engaging receptively, I'm appreciating aspects of the situation that exceed my competence or my understanding of what I'm doing.  Spiritual practice is largely about cultivating such receptivity. In a spiritual tradition that isn't world renouncing, though, that receptivity should feedback into activity. I should be competently shaping my world in light of my appreciation for the ways in which it fundamentally exceeds my grasp. I'm manipulating my environment with an underlying humility, but I'm confidently manipulating it, nevertheless.

The active mode of engagement feels like a flow state.  It's the experience that accompanies recognizing and applying patterns to a problem. It's the joy of competence. As a web developer, I might get a new feature request for an app:  _implement a notification that's visible for three seconds or until it's acknowledged by a user_. If I am in flow, I immediately recognize and apply a pattern: _just need a mini state machine that transitions when a race between a timer and click event completes_.  If I am in _full_ flow, I don't even consciously entertain that discursive thought. I _see_ the solution straight away, and my fingers start typing a keyboard shortcut into my editor.  I'm navigated to the first source code file I need to change to accommodate the feature request.  The pattern recognition is fully embodied and spontaneously discharged in sensorimotor activity. That sensorimotor activity reshapes my environmental niche to satisfy my goals. It's movie hacker stuff, except I'm making a popup instead of [misdirecting 60s idealism](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=coDtzN6bXAM) into black hat ops.

One issue, in web development and most task domains, is that I often need to get into flow when it's not arising spontaneously.  I might also need to get out of it, when it's arising non-congruently (i.e., when my spontaneously recognized and applied patterns are blind to crucial features of my situation).  

For example, I might need to bootstrap flow because it requires a "challenging enough" problem to get going.  If the problem is too easy, it's not engaging.   If it's too hard, it's painful to focus on.  It can be a struggle to stay focused enough to efficiently complete routine, but time-consuming bug fixes or features.  The latency is the result of getting distracted by more interesting questions, like, _Did Taylor Swift really say she has a thing for Ferret Daddies on SNL or this some autochthonous internet meme?_

Software development may be unique in that I always have the option of making routine, flow-resistant tasks more interesting by figuring out how to automate them.  For example, I can write a linter that will auto-fix routine bugs of the class I am currently working on.  That would be one way of displaying practical knowledge and achieving congruence. Routine practical activity that fits a wide range of situations gets offloaded to my artifactual, cognitive-behavioral extensions.  Attention is then freed to address more interesting problems.  In a virtuous feedback loop, I could then focus on building yet more tools for completing tasks that address an even wider (or less routine) range of problems.  

However, at least on an individual level, automation may not always be practicable. I may lack the requisite intersection of time and skill to script the tooling I would need.  Also, automation isn't costless.  Tools and automation need to be maintained like anything else.  The task of learning to use and maintain them can easily get as routinely dreary or difficult as any first-order app development task.  Flow is elusive, life is suffering, etc.

Here, spiritual practices or other cognitive-behavioral supports can help.  If I routinely hold awareness open to what's arising on the cushion, I can, over time, increasingly find experiential space around drudgery off-the-cushion.  This keeps me from falling into neurotic motivational patterns in relation to the routine bullshit of work and life. I might feel the pull of routine bullshit when I want a break from dealing with complexity. I might push away from routine bullshit when I want excitement or a growth opportunity. I might regard routine bullshit with fatalism when it seems to accumulate inexorably, indifferent to my process-related work and life hacks. Letting the motivational drama of that neurotic push, pull, and indifference just play out in awareness, without manipulating or engaging it, helps me move on.  I acquire the freedom to just do the routine bullshit.

The other flow-killer is the task that's painful to focus on because it's too hard, relative to my current skill set.  In web development, that might be a feature request that I can't even begin to estimate effort on. I have no set of patterns available in nearby cognitive space for composing the right solution.  There's lots of well-worn [programming  advice](https://www.amazon.com/Think-Like-Programmer-Introduction-Creative/dp/1593274246) for dealing with such problems. It's usually some version of breaking things down into manageable chunks and working through them Whac-a-mole style.  Sometimes, though, I really do need an overarching insight that makes the problem workable and organizes my relationship to its parts.  I may need an overall view to even distinguish what the parts of a solution would be.

Here's where receptive engagement with my task environment can help. I let go of looking for patterns and focus on just articulating precisely what's experientially anomalous or illegibly different about the situation.  [Rubber ducking](https://medium.com/@katiebrouwers/why-rubber-ducking-is-one-of-your-greatest-resources-as-a-developer-99ac0ee5b70a), applied to a design problem rather than just a bug fix, is one way of doing this. If things go well, a solution will bubble up into awareness from my mind-brain's sub-personal background processing. Or, more likely, I'll get to the point where I can correctly frame the questions that will let me search for a canonical solution. At least in web development, it's very rare I'm facing a problem that isn't addressable by some selection and recombination of applicable models documented online.

The need to able to get out of non-congruent flow is maybe more interesting and less appreciated.  The receptive mode of task engagement, layered over the active mode, is again useful for this.  It allows me to appreciate things in my task environment that _should_ interrupt my flow. I can then put the breaks on. Warding off the danger of oblivious geeking is a good example. Oblivious geeking would be abstract displays of technical mastery or pattern recognition that are blind to concrete context and what a situation actually demands.  Think of the technically masterful sax player who's so far up his own ass on a solo that he's completely oblivious to what the other players are doing or how the audience is responding.  The awfulness of Phish, for example, seems rooted in their belief that a song can comprise cycles of oblivious instrumental geeking _so long as the geeks take equal turns_.  

In software, oblivious geeking can happen when developers are too pilled on the cleverness of their code to see how it impacts the whole system.  Having gotten really excited, say, by the challenge of making my five layers of [indirection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indirection) work, I don't pause to ask how well the solution fits within the existing architecture and ergonomics of the code.  Here's another place where the receptive mode of task engagement can help.   Awareness needs to be able to pan and zoom out, rather than just tunnel and zoom in, when its practically engaged.  

That means, in my case, seeing that my coding, like any other intervention in the world, isn't a just discrete problem-solving exercise (this is a limitation to standard ways of doing technical interviews...). It's an intervention in a complex system that includes every part of the development lifecycle.  That complex system includes the current state of the app code itself, the other developers and testers of the software (including their capacities and expectations), the pipeline for building and delivering it, and the conditions in the outside world where it's deployed and used.

Any part of that complex system may not be arranged in such a way to easily absorb the outflow of pattern I've spontaneously recognized and applied to solve a discrete problem.  In many areas, as an individual contributor, I'll likely need to bracket a consideration of all that complexity to get anything done.  Somebody, however, a lead or architect, needs to be constantly thinking about the big picture and evaluating individual contributions with reference to it.

Finally, regarding congruence, there's the panoramic view.  That involves seeing how practical activity achieves good fit not just between an agent and their micro situation, but with their macro situation as well--with their life, society, and moment in history.  Here, finally, we get to the outer reaches of congruence that are going to be the main subject matter of this Substack. I have an intellectual background that I think lets me see a different big picture than your average web developer and MBA student. That hopefully gives me a different way to evaluate the practical interventions that tech and business are making in the world.

##### _Pseudo-Isaac Chotiner: You seem to have lost track of the fact that this was a Q&A about your first newsletter with more than just one question.  You write about national decline and degeneracy. I'm getting real "9/11 clarified my values and I'm joining the CIA" vibes from it. Are you expressing imperialist nostalgia for the "American Century"?_

No, I'm more of an [Ambient Century](http://www.techsoc.com/ambient.htm) type of guy.  So I'm a globalist, but one looking for an [old weird](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invisible_Republic) globalist posse. I'm especially looking forward to the future of [global humanities](https://philpapers.org/archive/GANWPM.pdf). That said, I have pretty normie politics these days.  I think strong, competent nation states dedicated to economic growth are the proper vehicles of globalism. Those states need to be backed by shared notions of collective good that are at least semi-factually connected to a nation's history. Mythologization is inevitable in [imagined communities](https://cindyanguyen.com/2016/04/03/anderson_imagined_communities/). The question is how and when it's responsible and useful. I'd also want the benefits of economic growth to be much more evenly distributed within already-developed nations than they are currently. So I'm just a boring social democrat with, hopefully, weirder and more entertaining jokes.

##### _Aryeh Nielsen: You also mention Pinker's case for global economic optimism.  The Anti-Pinker-Bots accuse Pinker of mistaking a period where volatility is artificially suppressed for a "new normal", as it was in many other inter-war periods. Comments?_


If I had any confidence in my ability to forecast global trends, I'd try to find real money to invest and have actual skin in the game.  But, from a spiritual practice perspective, it's perhaps interesting to entertain the question, "what if we really are at the end of history?"  No revolutions or cataclysms are coming.  The late capitalist political and economic order will sustain itself indefinitely. The radical Left will never make another world actual. Fiat currency will do fine. Crypto will stay a speculative vehicle for the profits and savings of professionals that aren't being reinvested in new productive ventures that do tangible work with physical objects.  The world will continue to flatten culturally.  There will be hipster cupcake shops along the Great Wall of China and a Target in Piazza San Marco.  Maybe we inch towards progress at guaranteeing access to good housing, education, healthcare, and a baseline standard of living. There will be more nice parks and less cars.  We'll continue to have less children and more, still quite domain-specific, intelligent automation.

It's interesting what parts of such a world we find intolerable to contemplate.  That can be an entry to practice. Some of me certainly rebels against a lot of it.

##### _Aryen Nielsen: In what way does business life and spiritual life combine or stay separate for you?_

The tie is in the notion of "worldly business" in the newsletter, which casts a much wider net than profit-oriented enterprises. It's really any social venture that requires deliberate care, concern, and effort by people to sustain.  It's anything that produces the [tragically fragile](https://youtu.be/tWfK1E4L--c?t=930) attachments to the world that contemplative monasticism is traditionally supposed to separate you from. If you aren't just willing to just shrug off the transience of a social enterprise from a Himalayan cave, if you find part of your life's meaning bound up in trying to sustain it, then that's a spiritualized connection to worldly business.

Now, in our moment in history, participating in  profit-oriented enterprises that are part of a global capitalist economy is how many of us spend our days. Assuring their sustainability is what takes up a lot of our effort, care, and concern. There's plenty of political, cultural, and spiritual criticism that will tell you what's wrong about this picture. I think much, perhaps most of it, is right.  But I am going to focus a lot on the other side: what are some intimations of a better future implicit in the interventions industry is making in our world?

##### _Pseudo-Isaac Chotiner:  Aren't you just engaged in an obscurantist, ideological exercise of papering over the dystopia of our late capitalist world with some vaguely spiritual, Pynchon-knockoff prose?_

Well, I might have a different view of what's dystopian. Some of my most intense feelings of world-historical affirmation have come in anticipation of a second round of breadsticks at The Olive Garden.  In some ways, to put it too grandly, I'm trying to glean the material base for an intellectually honest  [Bodhisattva Vow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bodhisattva_vow). That base might look very different than those imagined by democratic socialists. Maybe flat, participatory, consensus-driven social enterprises can't scale compassion or secure livelihoods. Maybe we need more than other-regarding, self-abnegating attitudes.  Maybe Santideva is not the last word on the life of the Bodhisattva (a first step to inquiring will likely require me to have actually read Santideva). I'm looking for effective altruism, but without many of the rationalist assumptions of actually existing effective altruism.

##### _Aryeh Nielsen: Any movement can be replaced by a meme that refers to it. What is your opinion on the current state of social justice vs. ["Social Justice!!!"(tm) as a meme]?_

Ooh, thank you for the opportunity to position myself in the culture war.  I hope to get some canceled subscriptions.  Let's pick that question up at Denny's.
